## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## About

Simple interactive landing page with top nav and 4 sections. Each section has a corresponding image that will dissappear on mobile. Top nav disappears when user stops scrolling and reappears when user scrolls up. Top nav links down to it's corresponding section/anchor. 

Future upgrades for this project could include a webform and make this a campaign landing page for a lead generating campaign. Could also include an HTML5 video instead of images for better engagement.
